# Getting Started Together

After we invest, we ask founders to work with us for one hour per week for six weeks.

The goals are to:
1. Build a trusting relationship,
2. Understand your business, and
3. Maximize your odds of success.

Our process, described in the image below, is designed to do just that.

## 1. Understand Your Business
We'll start by documenting your business model with a strong focus on your value proposition. The Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas great tools for doing this.

## 2. Extract Risks and Hypotheses
Startups are about creating a bold vision and then systematically addressing the risks that stand in the way of achieving it.

So, the next step is to list all of the risks and assumptions in your model.

## 3. Prioritize Your Risks
Founders must tackle their most significant risks first. If your current model won't work, it's best to find one that will before it's too late.

Together we'll rank your risks from most to least "business-killing."

## 4. Build, Measure, and Learn
We'll design ways to test the riskiest parts of your model, run those tests, and learn from the results.

## 5. Repeat
Finally, we'll use what we learned to update your model and do it again until we've built something users love.
