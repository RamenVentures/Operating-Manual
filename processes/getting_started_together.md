# Getting Started Together

After we invest, we ask founders to work with us for one hour per week for six weeks.

The goals are to:
1. Build a trusting relationship,
2. Understand your business, and
3. Maximize your odds of success.

Our process, described in the image below, is designed to do just that.

## 1. Understand Your Business
We'll start by documenting your business model with a strong focus on your value proposition. The Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas great tools for doing this.

## 2. Document Your Risks and Hypotheses
Startups are about creating a bold vision and then systematically addressing the risks that stand in the way of achieving it.

So, the next step is to lists all of the risks and assumptions in your model.

## 3. Rank The Risks
Founders must tackle their most significant risks first. If your current model won't work, it's best to pivot and persevere now.

Together we'll rank your risks from most to least "business-killing."

## 4. Set Objectives
Once we've identified your top 2-3 risks, we'll create Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for solving them.

## 5. Build, Measure, and Learn
Finally, we'll meet once a week to brainstorm experiments we can run to address your risks, discuss results, and use what we've learned to update your model and make progress.

## 6. Repeat
We'll work together for six weeks to build a strong business.
