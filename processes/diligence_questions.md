# Diligence Questions

## Founders
- Are the founders ethical?
- Are the founders vesting?

## Cap Table
- Is the cap table lean and fair?
- Is the cap table free of preferential terms? (liquidity preferences, ratchets, super-voting rights)

## Fundraising
- Are they using a standard fundraising agreement and terms?
- Are all investors receiving equal treatment?
- Do we have pro-rata rights?
- Do we have information rights?
- Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?
- If later than Pre-Seed, do they have a strong lead investor who will also lead their _next_ round?

## Working Together
- Do the founders agree to [monthly updates](/samples/sample_monthly_update.md)?
