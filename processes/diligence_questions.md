# Diligence Questions

### Founders
- Are the founders ethical?
- Do they founders agree to [monthly updates](/samples/sample_monthly_update.md)?
- Have they been sending monthly updates to their existing supporters?

### Cap Table
- Is the cap table clean?
- Is the cap table fair? (no crazy liquidity preferences, ratchets, super-voting rights)

### Contracts
- Dot heir contracts and patents check out?

### Fundraising
- Are they using a standard fundraising agreement and terms?
- Are all investors receiving equal treatment?
- Do we have pro-rata rights?
- Are they raising the right amount?
- If later than Pre-Seed, do they have a strong lead investor who will also lead their _next_ round?
