## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To create massive abundance through technology.

### Our Strategy
Startups with an important mission - solving an important problem in a huge market - are the ones that change the world. But there's not enough early-stage support for these companies in Canada. We need more angels, especially those with experience building world-class companies, to support these high risk/high reward startups before they've found Product/Market Fit and can raise money from VCs.

We fill this gap.

We invest in startups with the potential to change the world when they're pre-Product/Market Fit and help them find it.

## Our Investment Thesis
Every startup is made up of three components:
* Market
* Team
* Product

We believe that a great market - a market with lots of real potential customers - pulls a product out of a startup. The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to solve an important problem. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.

We believe that great startups are:
- 75% Market
- 25% Team
- 0% Product

So, first, we look for companies with an important mission. Then, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate and capable of executing.

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process has four steps and is designed to uncover companies that fit [our thesis](#our-investment-thesis):

### Step 1: Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company might fit our thesis and we should learn more.

#### Our Questions
1. Who are the founders?
2. What does the company do?
3. Who is the target user?
4. What problem are they solving for them?
5. Is this an important problem?
6. Could this be a huge market?
7. Is this a market we understand or would like to?
8. Is something exceptional? (team, traction, or tech?)
9. Could we add value as investors?
10. Are they Pre-Seed? (Market, Problem, Team, MVP)

#### Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 2: Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Our Goal

To develop a deep understanding of your market, problem, and team.

#### Our Questions

##### Mission
- What do you do? (in one sentence)

##### Problem
- What problem are you solving?
- Who desperately needs this?

##### Market Size
- How big will this market be in 10 years?

##### Solution & Unique Value Prop
- How do solve the user’s problem?
- Why is this 10x better than existing alternatives?
- What is your unique insight?
- Why now and not before?
- What will your unfair advantage be?

##### Team
- Who is on the team and what does each person do?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

##### Business Model
- How will you make money?

##### Your Ask
- Are you raising now? How much and on what terms?
- Have you raised before? How much and on what terms?
- What milestones do you need to successfully raise your _next_ round?
- How will you use the funds to get there?
- Who’s committed?

### Step 3: Analysis

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

#### Our Questions

##### 1. Is this an important problem? (The Problem/Market Fit Test)

_[42% of startups die because there’s no market need.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_
- Who desperately needs the product? (best: founder, second best: founders know the target user _perfectly_)
- Is this a Top 3 problem for this target market?
- Is it frequent and painful?
- Is it under-served?
- Would customers immediately adopt a solution if it was provided it to them right now?

##### 2. Do early users love it? (The Product/Market Fit Test)

- Have they found a Product/Market Fit? Why or why not?
	- 5-7% week over week growth, mostly from word-of-mouth.
	- Retention cohorts that flatten.
	- 40% of users “very disappointed” if the product went away.
- Why is this not growing faster?

##### 3. Will this be a big market in 10 years, and will they win it? (The Great Market Test)

- Why will this be a big market in 10 years?
- Are they starting with a large part of a small market?
- If this worked, could a [$100M ARR](http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html), $250M GMV, or 10M user company be built in this market?

##### 4. Is their Unique Value Proposition unique? (The Unique Value Prop Test)
- Is this truly unique, or derivative? It’s easier to do something new and hard than something derivative and easy.
- Is this _new_ - 10x better or cheaper?

##### 5. What could this become? (The Black Swan Test)

If this _did_ work, what could it become?

Airbnb started as [strangers sleeping on air beds in your livingroom](https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084). Uber started as town cars for the 1%. As a fund, [the more experimental you are, the better the results](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/1008039058113626112).

##### 6. Will this be one of the most important companies on the planet? (The Mission Test)

- Will this mission attract and retain great people?

##### 7. Why now and not before? (The Insight/Timing/Secret Test)

What change (like Drucker’s Seven Sources of Innovation) has created this opportunity?
- **An Unexpected Success or Failure**: Has something unexpected happened?
- **An Incongruity**: Is there a gap between the way things are and they way they should be?
	- Between the reality of an industry and assumptions about it?
	- Between assumed and actual customer values?
- **A Process Need**: Are steps in a process missing, painful, or removable?
- **An Industry or Market Change**: Are regulations, technologies, or customer preferences changing?
- **A Demographics Change**: Are populations, income, education, or age changing?
- **A Change in Perception, Meaning, or Mood**: Has a widely held view of life changed?
- **New Knowledge**: Will a new technology make something possible, easier, cheaper, or more powerful?

##### 8. Are these world-class founders? (The Great Team Test)
- Is the ratio of progress/time in the top 10%?
- Is there a world-class technical founder?
- Are they attracting world-class people?
- Do they have perseverance?
- Are they coachable?
- Are they willing to be bold and experiment?

##### 9. Is this the right team? (The Founder/Market Fit Test)

_[22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_
- Are they irrationally passionate about this problem?
- Do they understand the history of the market they’re entering?

##### 10. What is exceptional? (The Outlier Test)

Is the team, traction, or tech anomalous?

##### 11. Can they create an Unfair Advantage? (The Unfair Advantage Test)

What will make this more powerful at scale and difficult to copy? [7 Powers](https://medium.com/@chrisstoneman/notes-on-7-powers-foundations-of-business-by-hamilton-helmer-5d20cfecc753)
- **Scale Economies**: Per unit cost declines as scale increases.
- **Network Economies**: The value to each user increases as new users join the network.
- **Counter Positioning**: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent can’t copy because it would damage their existing business.
- **Switching Costs**: The value loss expected by switching to an alternative.
- **Branding**: The attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering.
- **Cornered Resource**: Preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.
- **Process Power**: Company organization and activities which enable lower costs and/or superior product.


##### 12. Will they reach their next milestone? (The Staying Alive Test)

[30% of startups die because they run out of cash.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)

- What is required to successfully raise their _next_ round? (ie: GMV, MRR, DAUs)
- Will their use of funds get them there?
- Are they raising enough _this round_ to get there?

##### 13. Are we biased? (The Dumb Decision Test)
Are we suffering from one of many [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)?

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, start [Due Diligence](#due-diligence).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 4: Due Diligence
Our investment due diligence is designed to be lightweight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Our Goal

To ensure that the company and funding are structured for success.

#### Our Questions
##### Founders
- Are the founders ethical?
- Are the founders vesting?

##### Cap Table
- Is the cap table lean and fair?
- Is the cap table free of preferential terms? (liquidity preferences, ratchets, super-voting rights)

##### Fundraising
- Are they using a standard fundraising agreement and terms?
- Are all investors receiving equal treatment?
- Do we have pro-rata rights?
- Do we have information rights?
- Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?

##### Working Together
- Do the founders agree to monthly updates?

#### Requirements
1. Corporate Records
  - Cap table (including all option, note, and warrant holders)
  - Shareholder Agreement
  - Founder Vesting Agreements
  - Investor's Rights Agreement
  - Right of First Refusal Agreement
  - Voting Agreement
2. Past financing agreements

**If not yet**, we share our analysis and feedback.
