## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To create massive abundance through technology.

### Our Strategy
Startups with an important mission - solving an important problem in a huge market - are the ones that change the world. But there's not enough early-stage support for these companies in Canada. We need more angels, especially those with experience building world-class companies, to support these high risk/high reward startups before they've found Product/Market Fit and can raise money from VCs.

We fill this gap.

We invest in startups with the potential to change the world when they're pre-Product/Market Fit and help them find it.

## Our Investment Thesis
Every startup is made up of three components:
* Market
* Team
* Product

We believe that a great market - a market with lots of real potential customers - pulls a product out of a startup. The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to solve an important problem. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.

We believe that great startups are:
- 75% Market
- 25% Team
- 0% Product

So, first, we look for companies with an important mission. Then, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate and capable of executing.

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process has four steps and is designed to uncover companies that fit [our thesis](#our-investment-thesis):

### Step 1: Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company might fit our thesis and we should learn more.

#### Our Questions
1. Who are the founders?
2. What does the company do?
3. Could this be the future?
4. Could this be big?
5. Could this be 10x better than the present?
6. Do we believe this is important?
7. Is something exceptional? (team, traction, or tech?)
8. Are they Pre-Seed? (Problem, Target Users, Team, MVP)

#### Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 2: Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Our Goal

To develop a deep understanding of your market, problem, and team.

#### Our Questions

##### Mission & Vision
- What's your mission? (eg: "To organize the world’s information." - Google)
- What's your vision? What will the future look like in 10 years? (eg: "To provide access to the world’s information in one click." - Google)
- Is this the most ambitious thing you can work on?

##### Problem & Market
- What's the actual hard problem?
- Who desperately needs this?
- How big will this market be in 10 years?

##### Solution & Unique Value Prop
- How do solve the user’s problem?
- Why is this 10x better than the present?
- What is the unique insight/secret that enables this? Why now and not before?
- What will your unfair advantage be?

##### Team
- Who is on the team and what does each person do?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

##### Business Model
- How will you make money?

##### Your Ask
- Are you raising now? How much and on what terms?
- Have you raised before? How much and on what terms?
- What milestones do you need to successfully raise your _next_ round?
- How will you use the funds to get there?
- Who’s committed?

### Step 3: Analysis

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

#### Our Questions

##### 1. Is _this_ the future?
###### 1.1 Is this the future?
###### 1.2 Is this vision massively ambitious?
###### 1.3 What could this become?
Suspend disbelief. If this _did_ work, what could it become? (eg: Air mattresses -> Airbnb)

###### 1.4 Is this 10x better than the present?

###### 1.5 Do people want this?
_[42% of startups die because there’s no market need.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_
Who desperately needs the product? (best: founder, second best: founders know the target user _perfectly_)

###### 1.6 What is the unique insight/secret that enables this vision?
Is this truly unique, or derivative?

###### 1.7 Do we believe that this is important?

##### 2. Will _these_ founders create it?
###### 2.1 Are these massively ambitious, unstoppable, capable founders?
Like @pc, @tobi, or Elon Musk, are these bold, technical, personal growth-minded, and unstoppable founders?

###### 2.2 Do they live for _this_ mission?
_[22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

###### 2.3 Are the executing in the top 5%?

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, start [Due Diligence](#due-diligence).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 4: Due Diligence
Our investment due diligence is designed to be lightweight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Our Goal

To ensure that the company and funding are structured for success.

#### Our Questions
##### Founders
- Are the founders ethical?
- Are the founders vesting?

##### Cap Table
- Is the cap table lean and fair?
- Is the cap table free of preferential terms? (liquidity preferences, ratchets, super-voting rights)

##### Fundraising
- Are they using a standard fundraising agreement and terms?
- Are all investors receiving equal treatment?
- Do we have pro-rata rights?
- Do we have information rights?
- Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?

##### Working Together
- Do the founders agree to monthly updates?

#### Requirements
1. Corporate Records
  - Cap table (including all option, note, and warrant holders)
  - Shareholder Agreement
  - Founder Vesting Agreements
  - Investor's Rights Agreement
  - Right of First Refusal Agreement
  - Voting Agreement
2. Past financing agreements
3. Current financing docs
4. Three (3) latest investor update emails
5. Contact info for a few reference customers.

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, we [start helping](#how-we-help).

**If not yet**, we share our analysis and feedback.
