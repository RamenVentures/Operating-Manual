## Who We Are

Ramen Ventures is an angel fund in Toronto, Canada. We're run by:

## Why We Exist

#### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that innovation makes the world a better place.

#### Our Mission

Our mission at Ramen Ventures is twofold:

**To help founders create world-class companies like Shopify.**

Shopify is the fastest SaaS company to 1-billion dollars in revenue. Anywhere. Ever.

When it acquired our startup, Shopify had about 60 employees, powered 20,000 businesses, and was worth about $100 million. Today, Shopify has more than 3,000 employees, powers 700,000 businesses, and is valued around $17 billion.

As Shopify's first VP Product and Head of Engineering respectively, Adam and Josh learned how to scale a small Canadian startup to a World-leading company. We want to share the important lessons we learned with as many founders as possible.

**To help founders make the world a better place.**

Our life's work is to improve the world. We don't angel invest to make money; we do it to help great founders solve problems that will improve the lives of billions of people.

&nbsp;

## How We Help Founders
We help founders in a few unique ways.

**We're friends first and investors second.**

Our number one priority is that you're healthy and happy. We know how hard being a founder is - we're founders, too. That's why we're friends first and investors second. You can always be honest with us because, no matter what happens, we believe you come first.

**We're independent.**

Unlike VCs, we invest our own money. We'll always act in your long term best interest because our interests are 100% aligned with yours, and no one else.

**We help you grow into World-class founders.**

We know first-hand what it takes to be the founder a World-leading startup. We can coach you on becoming one, too.

**We help you create a World-class company.**

We've hired and lead hundreds of developers, product managers, and UX researchers. We can coach you on how to create a great culture that attracts and grows great people.

**We help you create World-class products.**

We've built products that have scaled to billions of dollars in revenue. We can coach you on how to create massively successful products.

---

The best founders schedule regular coaching sessions with us. They also call, text, and email us all the time asking us for help.

We'll watch your investor updates for opportunities to help, but it's up to you to make the most of us.

## Our Investment Thesis

First, we look for a startup that's found a group of Users with a important, painful, and valuable Problem. We call this having an "**Important Mission**."

Next, we look for founders who are trying to create an ambitious solution that's first, best, or unique. We call this having a "**Bold Vision**."

Finally, we look for founders with the passion, guts, and ability to actually create it. We call this having the "**Right Team**".

More specifically, we aspire to invest in companies that meet the following criteria:

- **Mission**: You could positively impact the lives of millions.
- **User Type**: Consumer, SMB
- **Problem Type**: The future of Creation (audio, video, programming, etc), E-commerce, Education, Environmental Sustainability, Food, Financial Wellbeing, Health and Longevity, Transportation, Work.
- **Solution Type**: It can become a Platform or Marketplace.
- **Enabling Technology**: VR/AR, AI, Quantum Computing, or some other Frontier Technology.
- **Stage**: "Pre-Seed"
	- **Market**: You've found early adopters in a market that could be big in the future.
	- **Problem**: You've validated a problem that's important, painful, valuable, and underserved. (I.e you've found Problem/Market Fit)
	- **Solution**: You've validated a vision that's first, best, or unique. (I.e you've found Problem/Solution Fit)
	- **Product**: You're working with early adopters to create and validate your MVP. (I.e you haven't yet found Product/Market Fit)
- **Founders**: The founding team can design, develop, and distribute your product.
- **Investment Size**: $100,000 CAD at Pre-Seed, and we exercise pro rata in later rounds.

## Our Investment Process
Our investment process is designed to find companies that fit our thesis while being _extremely_ founder-friendly: fast, honest, and transparent.

---

### Screening
Step 1 is to quickly screen your startup.

#### Goal

To understand, at a high level, what your startup does and whether it fits [our investment thesis](#our-investment-thesis).

#### Questions
We will look at the material you send us and ask ourselves our [Screening Questions](processes/screening_questions.md).

#### What We Need From You
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If your startup fits our thesis**, continue to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If not**, we share our analysis and feedback.

---

### Meeting
Step 2 is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Goal

To deeply understand your target users, problem, existing solutions, unique value prop, mission, vision, and team.

#### Questions
When we meet, we'll ask you our [Meeting Questions](/processes/meeting_questions.md).

#### What We Need From You
1. To meet you :)

#### Next Steps
**If we're excited**, start our [Learning](#learning).

**If not**, we share our feedback.

---

### Learning
We've learned from you and now it's time for us to learn from others, too. We'll talk users in your target market to learn about them and their problems. We'll also talk to people who know you about the traits we look for in founders.

#### Goal
To develop a first-hand knowledge of your team, target market, and the problem you're solving.

#### Questions
We'll reach out to your users and people you know and ask them our [Learning Questions](processes/learning_questions.md).

#### What We Need From You
- Three (3) most recent monthly update emails
- Intros to 2-3 early users
- Evidence of a real user problem, like:
	- User interview transcripts
	- Retention metrics
	- LOIs

#### Next Steps
**If users tell us that this problem is important**, start [Analysis](#analysis).

**If not**, we share our learnings and feedback.

---

### Analysis
Step 4 is where we decide whether your startup really fits [our investment thesis](#our-investment-thesis).

#### Goal

To decide whether we should pursue an investment in your startup.

#### Questions
First we fill our our [Investment Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xjd98CxxXduHbx7-rnTT9qj2--B0ZEee9uF7LLwSBcs/edit?pli=1#). It's full of questions we ask ourselves to understand if a startup fits our thesis.

We then turn our memo to an [Investment Scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u-wmovdbcJ5Nl9nWoCuEINg985URzh9cgd3du7kgLCM/edit?pli=1#gid=0). Our scorecard helps us make data-driven decisions based on what we think are the most important elements of a startup.

#### What We Need From You
Nothing :)

#### Next Steps
**If we want to invest**, start [Investment Diligence](#diligence).

**If not**, we share our analysis.

---

### Diligence
Step 5 is our investment due diligence. It's designed to be lightweight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Goal

To ensure that the company and funding are structured for success.

#### Questions
During this stage of the process we ask ourselves our [Diligence Questions](processes/diligence_questions.md).

#### What We Need From You
Access to a Data Room that includes your:

1. Corporate Documents
	- Shareholder Agreement
	- Director Resolutions
	- Employee Stock Options Plan

#### Next Steps

**If we can't**, we tell you why.

---

### Making Follow-On Investments

#### Goal
To decide whether or not to make additional investments in a portfolio company.

#### Questions
We'll go through your updates, and through any new material you and us and we'll ask ourselves our [Follow-On Questions](processes/follow_on_questions.md).

#### What We Need From You

Access to a Data Room that includes your:

1. Past and Current Financing Documents
	- Subscription/Share Purchase Agreements
	- SAFEs, Kisses, and Convertible Notes

## Working Together

Our [mission](#why-we-exist) is to help you be successful, and to do that, we only ask you for two things:

### Getting Started Together

We ask founders to spend some time [Getting Started Together](/processes/getting_started_together.md) with us after we invest.

### Staying In Touch

We ask you to stay in touch by:

1. Providing us with concise and regular [monthly updates](samples/sample_monthly_update.md).
2. Keeping an open and honest communication channel open. Some things shouldn't wait until a monthly update, so reach out whenever you want to talk.

Please don't only share good news; we'll be by your side on the best days and on the worst days.
