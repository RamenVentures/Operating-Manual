## 3. Our Investment Thesis
Every startup is made up of three components: Market, Team, and Product.

We believe that a great market - a market with lots of real potential customers - pulls product out of a startup. The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to solve an important problem. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.

So, we invest in companies solving painful and under-served problems in markets that will be huge, with a team that can execute.

## 5. Our Investment Questions
Because we invest pre-Product/Market Fit, our investment thesis is roughly:
- 75% Market
- 25% team
- 0% Product

To find companies that best fit our investment thesis, we ask ourselves:

**1. Will this be a huge market? (Great Market)**

Is this a huge but fragmented market, or a market that will be huge in the future?

**2. Is this a prime problem? (Problem/Market Fit)**

[_42% of startups die because there’s no market need._](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)
1. Does the target market consider this problem one of the top 3 problems they have?
2. Is it frequent and painful?
3. Is it under-served?
4. Would customers immediately adopt a solution if it was provided it to them right now?

**3. Will this be one of the most important companies on the planet? (Mission & Vision)**

Does this company have an important mission (a huge market and a painful problem)?

**4. Why now and not before? (Timing, Secret)**

Has a change (like one of Drucker’s Seven Sources of Innovation) created an opportunity for innovation?
- An Unexpected Success or Failure: Has something unexpected happened?
- An Incongruity: Is there a gap between the way things are and they way they should be?
	- Between the Reality of an Industry and Assumptions about it
	- Between Assumed and Actual Customer Values
- A Process Need: Are steps in a process missing, painful, or removable?
- An Industry or Market Change: Are regulations, technologies, or changing customer preferences disrupting an industry?
- A Change in Demographics: Are changes in populations, income, education, or age creating an opportunity?
- A Change in Perception, Meaning, or Mood: Has a widely held view of life changed? (ie: fat being bad vs good)
- New Knowledge: Will a new technology make something possible, easier, cheaper, or more powerful?

**5. Is this a world-class team? (Great Team) **

- Are the founders executing against the opportunity?
- Are they experimenting and learning rapidly?
- Are they attracting world-class people?

**6. Is this the right team? (Founder/Market Fit)**

[_22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem._](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)
- Are the founders irrationally passionate about this problem?
- Do they understand the history of the market they’re entering?

**7. What is anomalous?**

Is something exceptional? Traction? Team?

**8. Do customers love it? (Product/Market Fit)**

Have they found a value hypothesis that’s creating market pull?
- 5-7% week over week growth, mostly from word-of-mouth
- High engagement on the core action (ie: photos/user/day)
- 40% of customers be “very disappointed” if the product went away
- Retention cohorts that flatten

**9. What is the unfair advantage?**

Will they be able to build one of the [7 Powers]?
- Scale Economies: A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.
- Network Economies: The value of a service to each user increases as new users join the network.
- Counter Positioning: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent can’t copy because it would damage their existing business.
- Switching Costs: The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternative supplier for additional purchases.
- Branding: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historic info about the seller.
- Cornered Resource: Preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.
- Process Power: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product.

**10. Could this be a 50x? (4 in 1,000)**

Startups are dominated by power laws. [The top 10 unicorns are worth as much as the next 100 combined.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/unicorn-power-law/) [0.04% of investments return 50x.](https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html)

Can this team in this market at this valuation create a 50-100X return?
