## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To help great founders who are just starting up successfully solve important problems.

### Our Strategy
The World needs more founders solving important problems that affect millions or billions of people.

These ambitious startups seem very risky when they're just starting up. They need angel investors, especially in Canada, who encourage them to:
- Pursue an important problem
- Create a bold, ambitious vision
- Be friends - open, honest, empathetic, and understanding
- Embrace failure as part of pursing greatness

**We fill this gap.**

We make angel investments in great founders who have found an important problem to solve. Then, we help set an ambitious vision and successfully create it.

## Our Investment Thesis
First, we look for a startup that's found a group of Users with a important, painful, and valuable Problem. We call this having an "**Important Mission**."

Next, we look for founders who are trying to create an ambitious solution that's first, best, or unique. We call this having a "**Bold Vision**."

Finally, we look for founders with the passion, guts, and ability to actually create it. We call this having the "**Right Team**".

## Our Investment Process
Our investment process is designed to find companies that fit our thesis while being _extremely_ founder-friendly - fast, honest, and transparent. It has five steps:

---

### Screening
Step 1 is to quickly screen your startup.

#### Goal

To understand, at a high level, what your startup does and whether it might fit our thesis.

#### Questions
We ask ourselves:

1. Who are the founders? Do they have the "3 Ds (Design, Development, and Distribution)"?
2. What user niche are they trying to solve a problem for?
3. What problem are they solving for them?
4. Are any of our portfolio companies solving a similar problem?
5. Could this problem be extremely:
	- important to those users?
	- painful?
	- valuable? (something they'd pay for)
	- huge? (could extend to millions or billions in the future)
6. Is their unique value proposition extremely ambitious?
7. Is something exceptional? (eg: team, traction, or tech)
8. Are they at the stage we invest? Have they:
	- Found a user niche with an important problem? (Problem/Market Fit)
	- Found a unique value prop (UVP) that users love and will pay for? (Problem/Solution Fit)
	- Started creating a minimum viable product (MVP) to deliver their value prop? (working towards Product/Market Fit)

#### Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If your startup fits our thesis**, continue to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If not**, we share our analysis and feedback.

---

### Meeting
Step 2 is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Goal

To deeply understand your target users, problem, existing solutions, value prop, mission, vision, and team.

#### Questions
We ask you:

##### User, Problem, and Mission
- What users are you solving a problem for?
- What problem are you solving for them?
- How do you know it's important (to them)?
- How do you know it's painful?
- How do you know it's unsatisfied?
- How do you know it's valuable to solve it?
- What's your long-term mission? (eg: "To organize the world's information. - Google)

##### Unique Value Proposition, Solution, and Vision
- How will you solve the user’s problem?
- Why is this 10x better than the users' existing solutions?
- What is your unfair advantage? (ie: What makes you uniquely capable of doing this?)
- What will your accumulating advantage be? (ie: What will make this stronger over time?)
- What's your vision? What will the future look like in 10 years? (eg: "To provide access to the world’s information in one click." - Google)

##### Team
- Who is on the team and what does each person do?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

##### Your Fundraising
- How much are you raising and on what terms?
- How much have you raised before and on what terms?
- What milestones do you need to achieve to successfully raise your _next_ round?
- How will you use these funds to get there?
- Who’s committed?


#### Requirements
1. To meet you :)

#### Next Steps
**If we're excited**, start our [Learning](#learning).

**If not**, we share our feedback.

---

### Learning
Step 3 is to talk to users in your target market to learn more about them and their problems.

#### Goal
To develop a first-hand knowledge of your target market and their problems.

#### Questions
We'll chat with a few users in your target market and ask:
1. What is the problem you're trying to solve?
2. How important is this problem to you? Why?
3. How have you solved this problem in the past?
4. How painful was this? Why?
5. In a perfect world, how would you want this problem solved?
6. How would you feel if I told you that you could no longer use COMPANY?

#### Requirements
- Intros to 2-3 users in your target market

#### Next Steps
**If users tell us that this problem is important**, start [Analysis](#analysis).

**If not**, we share our learnings and feedback.

---

### Analysis
Step 4 is our analysis where we decide whether your startup fits our thesis.

#### Goal

To decide whether we should pursue an investment in your startup.

#### Questions
We ask ourselves:

**Have they discovered a problem important, painful, underserved, and valuable?**

_[42% of startups die because there’s no Market need.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

**How big could this become?**

What is the maximum possible valuation (as a proxy for societal impact)?

**What could this become?**

If this did work, what could it become? (eg: air beds in stragers' houses -> Airbnb)

**Do they have a _real_ unfair advantage?**

- Is this first, best, or unique?
- What is the unique insight/secret that enables this?
- Why now and not before?

**Will they have an accumulating advantage?**

_Over time, can this company create one of the [7 Powers](https://link.medium.com/nzL1AoOn2T)?_

**Will _these_ founders solve this problem**

_[22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

**Are they user-obsessed?**

_Are they practicing Customer Development by *constantly* working with early adopters to:_
- _Discover and understand problems?_
- _Validate solutions?_
- _Iterate on an MVP?_
- _Discover a business model?_

**Are they executing in the top 5%?**

#### Requirements
1. Hard evidence of a real user problem, like:
	- Customer interview transcripts
	- Alpha users
	- LOIs

#### Next Steps
**If we want to invest**, start [Investment Diligence](#diligence).

**If not**, we share our analysis.

---

### Diligence
Step 5 is our investment due diligence. It's designed to be lightweight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Goal

#### Questions
We ask ourselves:

##### Founders

- Is the cap table free of preferential terms? (liquidity preferences, ratchets, super-voting rights)

##### Fundraising
- Are they using a standard fundraising agreement and terms?
- Are all investors receiving equal treatment?
- Do we have pro-rata rights?
- Do we have information rights?
- Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?
- If later than Pre-Seed, do they have a strong lead investor who will also lead their _next_ round?

##### Working Together
- Do the founders agree to monthly updates?

#### Requirements
Access to a Data Room that includes your:
