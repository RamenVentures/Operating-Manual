## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To create massive abundance through technology.

### Our Strategy
Startups that go after the hardest problems in the biggest markets are the ones that change the world. But Canada has a funding gap. The most ambitious companies are also the most risky (at the start). Canada needs more angels, especially those who have helped build world-class companies, to help these companies when no one else will.

Our strategy is to invest in 100 companies working on hard problems in big markets and get them to Product/Market Fit.

## Our Investment Thesis
Every startup is made up of three components: Market, Team, and Product.

We believe that a great market - a market with lots of real potential customers - pulls product out of a startup. The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to solve an important problem. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.

First we look for companies with an important mission - that is, solving an important problem in a huge market. Then, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate and capable of executing. Our thesis is:
- 75% Market
- 25% Team
- 0% Product

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process is designed to help us find companies that fit our thesis: solving hard problems in big markets with irrationally passionate teams.

It has four steps:

### Our Initial Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

**Our Goal**

To decide if your company might fit our thesis and we should learn more.

**We Ask**
1. Describe the company in one sentence.
2. Who is their target market?
3. What problem are they solving?
4. Who are the founders and VIPs?
5. Will this be a huge market? (Great Market)
6. Is this a prime problem? (Problem/Market Fit)
7. Is this a world-class team? (Great Team)
8. Are they at the right stage?

**We Need**
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we send you our notes.

### Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

**Our Goal**

To develop a deep understanding of your market, problem, and team.

**We Ask**
1. What are you working on?
2. Why this? 
3. Why now? 
4. How does it work?
5. What’s your unfair advantage?
6. What is your competition?
7. What is your key metric and how is it growing?
8. How do you make money?
9. What are the top three reasons you might fail?
10. How much have you raised before? On what terms?
11. How much are you raising now? On what terms?
12. What will you use it for?
13. How long will it last?
14. How will you be different by your next raise?
15. Who's committed?
16. Why do you want us to invest?

### Our Investment Analysis

**Our Goal**

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

**We Ask**

#### 1. Will this be a huge market? (Great Market)

Is this a huge but fragmented market, or a small market that will be huge in the future?

#### 2. Is this a prime problem? (Problem/Market Fit)

_<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank">42% of startups die because there’s no market need.</a>_
1. Does the target market consider this problem one of the top 3 problems they have?
2. Is it frequent and painful?
3. Is it under-served?
4. Would customers immediately adopt a solution if it was provided it to them right now?

#### 3. Will this be one of the most important companies on the planet? (Mission & Vision)

Does this company have an important mission (a huge market with a painful problem)?

#### 4. Why now and not before? (Timing, Secret)

What change (like Drucker’s Seven Sources of Innovation) has created this opportunity?
- **An Unexpected Success or Failure**: Has something unexpected happened?
- **An Incongruity**: Is there a gap between the way things are and they way they should be?
	- Between the Reality of an Industry and Assumptions about it
	- Between Assumed and Actual Customer Values
- **A Process Need**: Are steps in a process missing, painful, or removable?
- **An Industry or Market Change**: Are regulations, technologies, or changing customer preferences disrupting an industry?
- **A Change in Demographics**: Are changes in populations, income, education, or age creating an opportunity?
- **A Change in Perception, Meaning, or Mood**: Has a widely held view of life changed? (ie: fat being bad vs good)
- **New Knowledge**: Will a new technology make something possible, easier, cheaper, or more powerful?

#### 5. Is this a world-class team? (Great Team)
Is there evidence of the founders:
- Executing successfully against the opportunity?
- Experimenting and learning rapidly?
- Attracting world-class people?

#### 6. Is this the right team? (Founder/Market Fit)

_<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank">22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.</a>_
- Are the founders irrationally passionate about this problem?
- Do they understand the history of the market they’re entering?

#### 7. What is anomalous?

Is something (traction, team) exceptional?

#### 8. Do customers love it? (Product/Market Fit)

Have they found a Value Hypothesis that’s creating market pull?
- 5-7% week over week growth, mostly from word-of-mouth
- High engagement on the core function
- 40% of users being “very disappointed” if the product went away
- Retention cohorts that flatten

#### 9. What is the unfair advantage?

Will they be able to build one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisstoneman/notes-on-7-powers-foundations-of-business-by-hamilton-helmer-5d20cfecc753" target="_blank">7 Powers</a>?
- **Scale Economies**: A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.
- **Network Economies**: The value of a service to each user increases as new users join the network.
- **Counter Positioning**: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent can’t copy because it would damage their existing business.
- **Switching Costs**: The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternative supplier for additional purchases.
- **Branding**: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historic info about the seller.
- **Cornered Resource**: Preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.
- **Process Power**: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product.

#### 10. Can this be a 50x?

Startups are dominated by power laws. <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/unicorn-power-law/" target="_blank">The top 10 unicorns are worth as much as the next 100 combined.</a> <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html">0.04% of investments return 50x.</a>.

Can this Team in this Market at this valuation be one of the 4/1,000 that create a 50-100x return?

**If yes**, move to [Investment Due Diligence](#investment-due-diligence).

**If no**, we send you our notes.

### Our Investment Due Diligence
Our investment due diligence is designed to be light weight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

**Our Goal**

To decide whether or not to invest.

**We Ask**
1. What do references say about the founders?
2. What do customers say about the company?
3. Is the cap table clean?
4. Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?
5. Do we have pro-rata rights? 
6. Do we have information rights?
7. Do the founders agree to monthly updates?
8. Are we suffering from any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_cognitive\_biases" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>?

**We Need**
1. Cap table
2. Company formation documents (Shareholder’s Agreement, Founder Vesting Agreements, etc)
3. Financing documents.
4. Contact information for a few reference customers.

**If yes**, we [start helping](#how-we-help).

**If no**, we send you our notes.
