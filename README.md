## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To help founders use technology to create abundance.

### Our Strategy
The World needs more founders working on Moonshot solutions to important problems that affect millions or billions of people.

These Moonshot companies are the ones who need the most support, especially when they're just starting up. They need investors who:
- Encourage them to pursue an important Mission and Moonshot Vision.
- Recognize failure as part of pursing greatness, and value it as an opportunity to learn.
- Bring diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and ways of thinking.
- Focus on asking the right questions, not just getting answers.

But there's not enough support for scary ambitious startups, especially in Canada. We need more angels, especially those with experience building world-class companies, to help them.

We fill this gap.

We invest in founders working on Moonshots when they're Pre-Product/Market Fit, then help them get to Product/Market Fit (while staying ambitious).

## Our Investment Thesis
We believe that every startup is made up of three main pieces:
* A Market (a Problem and Users)
* A Product (a Unique Value Proposition and Solution)
* A Team

First, we look for companies working on a huge, important, and valuable Problem for Users who desperately need it solved. We call this having an "**Important Mission**."

Next, we look for companies trying to solve the Problem in a way that's 10x, not 10%, better than today. We call this having a "**Moonshot Vision**."

Finally, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate about this Important Mission, has the ambition to pursue a Moonshot Vision, and the aptitude to execute on it. We call this having the "**Right Team**".

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process has four steps and is designed to uncover companies that fit [our thesis](#our-investment-thesis):

### Step 1: Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

#### Our Screening Goal

To decide if your company might fit our Thesis and we should learn more.

#### Our Screening Questions
1. Who are the founders?
2. What Problem does this company solve?
3. For what specific Users?
4. Could this Problem be important?
5. Could this Problem be huge?
6. Could this Vision be a Moonshot?
7. Is something exceptional? (eg: team, traction, or tech)
8. Are they "Pre-Seed"?
  - Have they picked a Problem, Users, and Unique Value Prop?
  - Have they made significant progress towards an MVP Solution?
  - Does their Team have the ability to build, and maintain their product in-house?

#### Our Screening Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Our Screening Next Steps
**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 2: Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Our Meeting Goal

To develop a deep understanding of your Problem, Users, Unique Value Prop, and Team.

#### Our Meeting Questions

##### Mission
- What's your mission? (eg: "To organize the world’s information." - Google)
- What specific Problem are you trying to solve?
- Why is this Problem important? Who desperately needs this solved?
- Why is this Problem huge? Does it affect millions or billions?
- Why is this Problem valuable?

##### Vision
- What's your vision? What will the future look like in 10 years? (eg: "To provide access to the world’s information in one click." - Google)
- How do you solve the user’s problem?
- Why is this 10x better than the present?
- What is the unique Insight/Secret that enables this? Why now and not before?
- What will your Unfair Advantage be?

##### Team
- Who is on the team and what does each person do?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

##### Business Model
- How will you make money?

##### Your Fundraising
- Are you raising now? How much and on what terms?
- Have you raised before? How much and on what terms?
- What milestones do you need to successfully raise your _next_ round?
- How will you use the funds to get there?
- Who’s committed?

### Step 3: Analysis

#### Our Analysis Goal

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

#### Our Analysis Questions

##### 1. Is _this_ the future?
To answer this, we ask:

###### 1.1 Could this Problem be huge?
Could solving this specific Problem improve the lives of millions or even billions?

###### 1.2 Could this Problem be important?
Who desperately needs the Problem solved?
_[42% of startups die because there’s no Market need.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

###### 1.3 Could this Problem be valuable?
Would solving this Problem create a ton of value, and is there a way for the company to capture some of that value?

###### 1.4 Is this Vision a Moonshot?
Is this a radical solution that could be 10x, not 10%, better?

###### 1.5 What is the unique insight/secret that enables this Vision?
Why now and not before?

###### 1.6 What could this become?
Suspend disbelief. If this did work, what could it become? (eg: Air mattresses in stragers' houses -> Airbnb)

###### 1.7 Do _we_ believe in this Mission and Vision?

##### 2. Will _these_ founders create it?
To answer this, we ask:

###### 2.1 Do they have the right aptitude?
_[22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_
Are they world-class in this Problem?

###### 2.2 Do they have the right attitude?
Like @pc, @tobi, or Elon Musk, are they bold, personal growth-minded, unstoppable, mission-driven founders? Do we believe that they believe in this mission?

###### 2.3 Are they executing in the top 5%?

#### Our Analysis Next Steps
**If yes**, start [Due Diligence](#due-diligence).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 4: Investment Diligence
Our investment due diligence is designed to be lightweight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Our Investment Diligence Goal

To ensure that the company and funding are structured for success.

#### Our Investment Diligence Questions
##### Founders
- Are the founders ethical?
- Are the founders vesting?

##### Cap Table
- Is the cap table lean and fair?
- Is the cap table free of preferential terms? (liquidity preferences, ratchets, super-voting rights)

##### Fundraising
- Are they using a standard fundraising agreement and terms?
- Are all investors receiving equal treatment?
- Do we have pro-rata rights?
- Do we have information rights?
- Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?
- If later than Pre-Seed, do they have a strong lead investor who will also lead their _next_ round?

##### Working Together
- Do the founders agree to monthly updates?

#### Our Investment Diligence Requirements

1. Corporate Documents
