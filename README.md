## Who We Are

Ramen Ventures is an angel fund in Toronto, Canada. We're run by:

### <a href="http://www.twitter.com/adammcnamara" target="_blank">Adam McNamara</a>, Founding Partner

Adam was the first VP Product at <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> where he helped create the Product strategies that Shopify has used to grow from a $100M to $17B company.

### <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshpc" target="_blank">Joshua Tessier</a>, Founding Partner

Josh was the first Head of Core Product Engineering at  <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank">Shopify</a> where he hired, trained, and lead hundreds of engineers to build software that powers 700,000+ businesses and $10B/year in sales.

### <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alizhd" target="_blank">Ali Zahid</a>, Associate

Ali founded <a href="http://www.vanhawks.com" target="_blank">Vanhawks</a>, a Y Combinator-backed startup that made the world's first smart carbon fibre bike.

## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that innovation makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission

Our mission at Ramen Ventures is to achieve two goals:

**Help founders create world-class companies like Shopify.**

Shopify is the fastest SaaS company to 1-billion dollars in revenue. Anywhere. Ever.

When it acquired our startup, Shopify had about 60 employees, powered 20,000 businesses, and was worth about $100 million. Today, Shopify has more than 3,000 employees, powers 700,000 businesses, and is valued around $17 billion.

As Shopify's first VP Product and Head of Engineering respectively, Adam and Josh learned how to scale from small Canadian startup to World-leading company. We want to share the important lessons we learned with as many founders as possible.

**Help founders make the world a better place.**

Our life's work is to improve the world. We don't angel invest to make money; we do it to help great founders solve problems that will improve the lives of billions of people.

## How We Help Founders
We help founders in a few unique ways.

**We're friends first and investors second.**

Our number one priority is that you're healthy and happy. We know how hard being a founder is - we're founders, too. That's why we're friends first and investors second. You can always be honest with us because, no matter what happens, we believe you come first.

**We're independent.**

Unlike VCs, we invest our own money. We'll always act in your long term best interest, because our interests are 100% aligned with yours, and no one else.

**We help you grow into World-class founders.**

We know first-hand what it takes to be the founder a World-leading startup. We can coach you on becoming one, too.

**We help you create a World-class company.**

We've hired and lead hundreds of developers, product managers, and UX researchers. We can coach you on how to create a great culture that attracts and grows great people.

**We help you create World-class products.**

We've built products that have scaled to billions of dollars in revenue. We can coach you on how to create massively successful products.

---

The best founders schedule regular coaching sessions with us. They also call, text, and email us all the time asking us for help.

We'll watch your investor updates for opportunities to help, but it's up to you to make the most of us.

## Our Investment Thesis

### Our Thesis

First, we look for a startup that's found a group of Users with a important, painful, and valuable Problem. We call this having an "**Important Mission**."

Next, we look for founders who are trying to create an ambitious solution that's first, best, or unique. We call this having a "**Bold Vision**."

Finally, we look for founders with the passion, guts, and ability to actually create it. We call this having the "**Right Team**".

### Our Investment Criteria

	- **Market**: You've found a small niche of users in a market with the potential to be massive. (marketplaces, consumer SaaS, SMB SaaS, etc.)
	- **Problem**: You've validated a problem that's important, painful, valuable, and underserved. (I.e you've found Problem/Market Fit)
	- **Unique Value Proposition**: You've validated a vision that's first, best, or unique. (I.e you've found Problem/Solution Fit)

## Our Investment Process
Our investment process is designed to find companies that fit our thesis while being _extremely_ founder-friendly - fast, honest, and transparent. It has five steps:

---

### Screening
Step 1 is to quickly screen your startup.

To understand, at a high level, what your startup does and whether it fits [our investment thesis](#our-investment-thesis).

#### Questions
We ask ourselves:

1. Who are the founders?
2. What user niche are they trying to solve a problem for?
3. What problem are they solving for them?
4. Are any of our portfolio companies solving a similar problem?
5. Do they fit [our investment thesis](#our-investment-thesis)?
	- Type?
	- Geography?
	- Market?
	- Problem?
	- Unique Value Prop?
	- Product?
	- Founding Team?

#### Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If your startup fits our thesis**, continue to [Meeting](#meeting).

### Meeting
Step 2 is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Goal

#### Questions
We ask you:

- What's your long-term mission? (eg: "To organize the world's information. - Google)

##### Unique Value Proposition, Solution, and Vision
- How will you solve the user’s problem?
- Why is this 10x better than the users' existing solutions?
- What is your unfair advantage? (ie: What makes you uniquely capable of doing this?)
- What will your accumulating advantage be? (ie: What will make this stronger over time?)
- What's your vision? What will the future look like in 10 years? (eg: "To provide access to the world’s information in one click." - Google)

##### Team
- Who is on the team and what does each person do?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

### Learning
Step 3 is to talk to users in your target market to learn more about them and their problems.

#### Goal
To develop a first-hand knowledge of your target market and their problems.

#### Questions
We'll chat with a few users in your target market and ask:
1. What is the problem you're trying to solve?
2. How important is this problem to you? Why?
3. How have you solved this problem in the past?
4. How painful was this? Why?
5. In a perfect world, how would you want this problem solved?
6. How would you feel if I told you that you could no longer use COMPANY?

#### Requirements
- Intros to 2-3 users in your target market

#### Next Steps
**If users tell us that this problem is important**, start [Analysis](#analysis).

**If not**, we share our learnings and feedback.

---

### Analysis
Step 4 is where we decide whether your startup really fits [our investment thesis](#our-investment-thesis).

#### Goal

To decide whether we should pursue an investment in your startup.

#### Questions
We ask ourselves:

**Have they discovered a problem that's important, painful, underserved, and valuable?**

_[42% of startups die because there’s no Market need.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

**How big could this become?**

What is the maximum possible valuation this startup could achieve (as a proxy for value created for society)?

**What could this become?**

If this did work, what could it become? (eg: air beds in stragers' houses -> Airbnb)

**Do they have a _real_ unfair advantage?**

- Is this first, best, or unique?
- What is the unique insight/secret that enables this?
- Why now and not before?

**Will they have an accumulating advantage?**

_Over time, can this company create one of the [7 Powers](https://link.medium.com/nzL1AoOn2T)?_

**Will _these_ founders solve this problem**

_[22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

**Are they user-obsessed?**

_Are they practicing Customer Development by *constantly* working with early adopters to:_
- _Discover and understand problems?_
