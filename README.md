## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To help founders who are building moonshot solutions to important problems in every way we can.

### Our Strategy
The World needs more founders working on Moonshot solutions to important problems that affect millions or billions of people.

These Moonshot companies are the ones who need the most support, especially when they're just starting up. They need investors who:
- Encourage them to pursue an important Mission and Moonshot Vision.
- Recognize failure as part of pursing greatness, and value it as an opportunity to learn.
- Bring diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and ways of thinking.
- Focus on asking the right questions, not just getting answers.

But there's not enough support for scary ambitious startups, especially in Canada. We need more angels, especially those with experience building world-class companies, to help them.

We fill this gap.

We invest in founders working on Moonshots when they're Pre-Product/Market Fit, then help them get to Product/Market Fit (while staying ambitious).

## Our Investment Thesis
We believe that every startup is made up of three main pieces:
- A Market (a Problem and Users)
- A Product (a Unique Value Proposition and Solution)
- A Team

First, we look for companies working on a huge, important, and valuable Problem for Users who desperately need it solved. We call this having an "**Important Mission**."

Next, we look for companies trying to solve the Problem in a way that's 10x, not 10%, better than today. We call this having a "**Moonshot Vision**."

Finally, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate about this Important Mission, has the ambition to pursue a Moonshot Vision, and the aptitude to execute on it. We call this having the "**Right Team**".

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process has four steps and is designed to uncover companies that fit [our thesis](#our-investment-thesis):

### Step 1: Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

#### Our Screening Goal

To decide if your company might fit our Thesis and we should learn more.

#### Our Screening Questions
1. Who are the founders and do they have the "3 Ds" (Design, Development, and Distribution)?
2. What user niche are they trying to solve a problem for?
3. What problem are they solving for them?
4. Could this problem be extremely:
	- important to those users?
	- painful?
	- valuable? (something they'd pay for)
	- huge? (could extend to millions or billions in the future)
5. Is their unique value proposition extremely ambitious?
6. Is something exceptional? (eg: team, traction, or tech)
7. Are they "Pre-Seed"?
	- Have they discovered a user niche and problem?
	- Have they discovered a unique value prop that users love?
	- Have they made significant progress towards a minimum viable product (MVP) to deliver the UVP?
	- Do they have the ability to build, and maintain their product in-house?

#### Our Screening Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Our Screening Next Steps
**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 2: Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Our Meeting Goal

To develop a deep understanding of your users, problem, value prop, mission, vision, and team.

#### Our Meeting Questions

##### User, Problem, and Mission
- What users are you solving a problem for?
- What problem are you solving for them?
- How do you know it's important (to them)?
- How do you know it's painful?
- How do you know it's unsatisfied?
- How do you know it's valuable to solve it?
- What's your long-term mission? (eg: "To organize the world's information. - Google)

##### Unique Value Proposition, Solution, and Vision
- How will you solve the user’s problem?
- Why is this 10x better than the users' existing solutions?
- What is your unfair advantage? (ie: What makes you uniquely capable of doing this?)
- What will your accumulating advantage be? (ie: What will make this stronger over time?)
- What's your vision? What will the future look like in 10 years? (eg: "To provide access to the world’s information in one click." - Google)

##### Team
- Who is on the team and what does each person do?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

##### Your Fundraising
- How much are you raising and on what terms?
- How much have you raised before and on what terms?
- What milestones do you need to achieve to successfully raise your _next_ round?
- How will you use these funds to get there?
- Who’s committed?

### Step 3: Analysis

#### Our Analysis Goal

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

#### Our Analysis Questions

##### 1. Is _this_ the future?
To answer this, we ask:

###### 1.1 Have they discovered a problem important, painful, underserved, and valuable?
_[42% of startups die because there’s no Market need.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

###### 1.2 Do they have evidence of problem validation?
Do they have:
- Customer interview transcripts?
- LOIs?
	
##### 1.3 Have they discovered a unique value prop that's 10x better than existing alternatives?

##### 1.4 Do they have evidence of solution validation?
Do they have:
- An MVP with early adopters?
- Would 40% of them be "very disappointed" if it went away?

###### 1.5 Do they have a _real_ unfair advantage?
Is this first, best, or unique?
What is the unique insight/secret that enables this?
Why now and not before?

###### 1.6 Will they have a _real_ accumulating advantage?
Can they build one of the 7 Powers?

###### 1.7 Could this problem be huge?
Could millions of people have this same problem?

###### 1.8 What could this become?
Suspend disbelief. If this did work, what could it become? (eg: Air mattresses in stragers' houses -> Airbnb)

##### 2. Will _these_ founders create it?
To answer this, we ask:

###### 2.1 Do they deeply understand these users and this problem?
_[22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/)_

###### 2.1 Do they have evidence that they're practicing Customer Development?
Are they *constantly* working with early adopters to:
- Discover and understand problems?
- Validate solutions?
- Iterate on an MVP?
- Discover a business model?

###### 2.2 Are they executing in the top 5%?

#### Our Analysis Requirements
1. Hard evidence of a real user problem, like:
	- Customer interview transcripts
	- Alpha users
	- LOIs

#### Our Analysis Next Steps
**If yes**, start [Due Diligence](#due-diligence).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.
