## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To create massive abundance through technology.

### Our Strategy
Startups with an important mission - solving an important problem in a huge market - are the ones that change the world. But there's not enough early-stage support for these companies in Canada. We need more angels, especially those with experience building world-class companies, to support these high risk/high reward startups before they've found Product/Market Fit and can raise money from VCs.

We fill this gap.

We invest in startups with the potential to change the world when they're pre-Product/Market Fit and help them find it.

## Our Investment Thesis
Every startup is made up of three components:
* Market
* Team
* Product

We believe that a great market - a market with lots of real potential customers - pulls product out of a startup. The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to solve an important problem. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.

We believe that great startups are:
- 75% Market
- 25% Team
- 0% Product

So, first we look for companies with an important mission. Then, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate and capable of executing.

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process has four steps and is designed to uncover companies that fit [our thesis](#our-investment-thesis):

### Step 1: Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company might fit our thesis and we should learn more.

#### Our Questions
1. What does the company do?
2. Will this be an important problem for a lot of people?
3. Is this a problem we understand or would like to?
4. Are the founders people we should know?
5. Are they Pre-Seed (Team, Problem, and MVP?)

#### Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 2: Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Our Goal

To develop a deep understanding of your market, problem, and team.

#### Our Questions

##### Mission
- What do you do? (in one sentence)

##### Problem
- Who is the target user?
- What is their problem?
- How do you know this is a real problem?

##### Market Size
- How big is this market?

##### Solution
- How do solve the user’s problem?
- Why this way?

##### Insight
- What is your unique insight?
- What will your unfair advantage be?
- Why now and not before?

##### Team
- Who is on the team?
- What is your history together?
- Why work on _this_ problem?
- What does each person do?
- Is everyone full time?
- How is equity split?

##### Progress
- What is the timeline of the company until now?
- What progress have you achieved in that time?

##### Business Model
- How will you make money?

##### Your Ask
- Are you raising now? How much and on what terms?
- Have you raised before? How much and on what terms?
- What will you use it for?
- How will you be different by your next raise?
- Who’s committed?

### Step 3: Analysis

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

#### Our Questions

##### 1. Could this be a huge and valuable market? (Great Market)

- Is this a huge but fragmented market, or a small market that could become huge?
- If this worked, could a [$100M ARR](http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html), $250M GMV, or 10M user company be built in this market?

##### 2. Is this an important problem? (Problem/Market Fit)

_<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank">42% of startups die because there’s no market need.</a>_
- Is this a Top 3 problem for this target market?
- Is it frequent and painful?
- Is it under-served?
- Would customers immediately adopt a solution if it was provided it to them right now?

##### 3. What could this become? (Black Swan)

If this _did_ work, what could it become?

Airbnb started as [strangers sleeping on air beds in your livingroom](https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084). Uber started as towncars for the 1%.

As a fund, [the more experimental you are, the better the results](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/1008039058113626112).

##### 4. Will this be one of the most important companies on the planet? (Mission & Vision)

Will this mission attract and retain great people?

##### 5. Why now and not before? (Timing, Secret)

What change or lack of change (like Drucker’s Seven Sources of Innovation) has created this opportunity?
- **An Unexpected Success or Failure**: Has something unexpected happened?
- **An Incongruity**: Is there a gap between the way things are and they way they should be?
	- Between the Reality of an Industry and Assumptions about it
	- Between Assumed and Actual Customer Values
- **A Process Need**: Are steps in a process missing, painful, or removable?
- **An Industry or Market Change**: Are regulations, technologies, or changing customer preferences disrupting an industry?
- **A Change in Demographics**: Are changes in populations, income, education, or age creating an opportunity?
- **A Change in Perception, Meaning, or Mood**: Has a widely held view of life changed? (ie: fat being bad vs good)
- **New Knowledge**: Will a new technology make something possible, easier, cheaper, or more powerful?

##### 6. Are these world-class founders? (Great Team)
- Is the ratio of progress / time in the top 10%?
- Are they attracting world-class people?
- Do they have perserverance?
- Are they coachable?
- Are they willing to be bold and experiment?

##### 7. Is this the right team? (Founder/Market Fit)

_<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank">22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.</a>_
- Are they irrationally passionate about this problem?
- Do they understand the history of the market they’re entering?

##### 8. What is anomalous?

Is something (traction, team) exceptional?

##### 9. Do early users love it? (Product/Market Fit)

Have they found a [Value Hypothesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Psagej75WSLUNrTHq9zJ9ThDY_aKGvjD) that’s creating market pull?
- 5-7% week over week growth, mostly from word-of-mouth
- High engagement on the core function
- 40% of users being “very disappointed” if the product went away
- Retention cohorts that flatten

##### 10. Can they create an unfair advantage? (Unfair Advantage)

Will they be able to build one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisstoneman/notes-on-7-powers-foundations-of-business-by-hamilton-helmer-5d20cfecc753" target="_blank">7 Powers</a>?
- **Scale Economies**: A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.
- **Network Economies**: The value of a service to each user increases as new users join the network.
- **Counter Positioning**: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent can’t copy because it would damage their existing business.
- **Switching Costs**: The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternative supplier for additional purchases.
- **Branding**: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historic info about the seller.
- **Cornered Resource**: Preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.
- **Process Power**: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product.

##### 11. Are we biased?
Are we suffering from one of many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_cognitive\_biases" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>?

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, start [Due Diligence](#due-diligence).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 4: Due Diligence
Our investment due diligence is designed to be light weight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Our Goal

To decide whether or not to invest.

#### Our Questions
1. What do references say about the founders?
2. What do customers say about the company?
3. Is the cap table clean?
4. Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?
5. Do we have pro-rata rights? 
6. Do we have information rights?
7. Do the founders agree to monthly updates?

#### Requirements
1. Cap table
2. Company formation documents (Shareholder’s Agreement, Founder Vesting Agreements, etc)
3. Financing documents.
4. Contact information for a few reference customers.

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, we [start helping](#how-we-help).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.
