## Why We Exist

#### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to be happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise, and that we should all live sustainably on Spaceship Earth.

#### Our Mission

Our mission is **improve the lives of billions and the long-term future of humanity.** We invest in mission-driven founders using emerging science and technology
‍to solve important problems.

We'll back world-changing, crazy-sounding ideas across all markets: AI, aerospace, biotech, cleantech, fintech, health, SaaS, AR/VR, and more.

## How We Help Founders
We help founders in a few unique ways.

**We're friends first and investors second.**

Our number one priority is that you're healthy and happy. We know how hard being a founder is - we're founders, too. That's why we're friends first and investors second. You can always be honest with us because, no matter what happens, you come first.

**We're independent.**

Unlike VCs, we invest our own money. We'll always act in your long term best interest because our interests are 100% aligned with yours, and no one else.

**We help you grow into World-class founders.**

We know first-hand what it takes to build a World-changing startup. We can help you build one, too.

**We help you create a World-class company.**

We've hired and lead hundreds of developers, product managers, and UX researchers. We can help you create a great culture that attracts and grows great people.

**We help you create World-class products.**

We've built products that have scaled to billions of dollars in revenue. We can help you create massively successful products.

We watch your investor updates for opportunities to help. But, the best founders call, text, and email us asking us with specific asks.

&nbsp;

## Our Investment Thesis

First, we look for a "**Mission That Matters**", like fixing important problems in Food, Health, Climate, Space, Transportation, etc.

Next, we look for a moonshot solution that's first, best, or unique. We call this having a "**Bold Vision**."

Finally, we look for founders with the passion, guts, and ability to actually create it. We call this having the "**Right Team**".

Our first cheque is $100,000-$250,000 and more later.
