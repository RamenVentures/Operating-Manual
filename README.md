## Why We Exist

### Our Philosophy
> “Technology not only moves the human race forward, it’s the only thing that ever has. Without technology, we’re just monkeys playing in the dirt.” \- Naval Ravikant

We're rational optimists who believe that technology creates abundance and makes the world a better place.

### Our Mission
To create massive abundance through technology.

### Our Strategy
Startups with an important mission - solving an important problem in a huge market - are the ones that change the world. But there's not enough early-stage support for these companies in Canada. We need more angels, especially those with experience building world-class companies, to support these high risk/high reward startups before they've found Product/Market Fit and can raise money from VCs.

We fill this gap.

We invest in startups with the potential to change the world when they're pre-Product/Market Fit and help them find it.

## Our Investment Thesis
Every startup is made up of three components:
* Market
* Team
* Product

We believe that a great market - a market with lots of real potential customers - pulls product out of a startup. The product doesn't need to be great; it just has to solve an important problem. And, the market doesn't care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.

We believe that great startups are:
- 75% Market
- 25% Team
- 0% Product

So, first we look for companies with an important mission. Then, we look for a team that's irrationally passionate and capable of executing.

## Our Investment Process
We strive to be known as the most founder-friendly investors in Canada. To that end, we:
- Make investment decisions quickly, usually within 48 hours of [Meeting](#meeting).
- Invest $50,000 CAD on your existing terms.

Our investment process has four steps and is designed to uncover companies that fit [our thesis](#our-investment-thesis):

### Step 1: Screening
Our first step is to quickly filter all of the opportunities we see.

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company might fit our thesis and we should learn more.

#### Our Questions
1. Describe the company in one sentence.
2. Who is their target market?
3. What problem are they solving?
4. Could this be a huge market? (Great Market)
5. Is this a prime problem? (Problem/Market Fit)
6. What could this become? (Black Swan)
7. Who are the founders and VIPs?
8. Is this a world-class team? (Great Team)
9. Are they at the right stage? (Pre-Seed)

#### Requirements
1. Your deck (if you have one)
2. A link to your MVP

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, move to [Meeting](#meeting).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 2: Meeting
Our next step is to meet your founding team, preferably face-to-face.

#### Our Goal

To develop a deep understanding of your market, problem, and team.

#### Our Questions
1. Describe your company in one sentence.
2. Who's the target market?
3. What problem are you solving?
4. How do you know this is a real problem?
5. How do you solve it?
6. Why solve it this way?
7. What's your long term vision?
8. Why are you working on this?
9. Why now?
10. What’s your unfair advantage?
11. What's your competition?
12. What's your key metric and how is it growing?
13. How do you make money?
14. What are the top three reasons you might fail?
15. How much have you raised before? On what terms?
16. How much are you raising now? On what terms?
17. What will you use it for?
18. How long will it last?
19. How will you be different by your next raise?
20. What investors are committed?
21. Why do you want us?

### Step 3: Analysis

#### Our Goal

To decide if your company really does fit our thesis and we should pursue an investment.

#### Our Questions

##### 1. Could this be a huge and valuable market? (Great Market)

- Is this a huge but fragmented market, or a small market that could become huge?
- If this worked, could a [$100M ARR SaaS](http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html) or $250M GMV Marketplace be built in this market?

##### 2. Is this a prime problem? (Problem/Market Fit)

_<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank">42% of startups die because there’s no market need.</a>_
- Is this a Top 3 problem for this target market?
- Is it frequent and painful?
- Is it under-served?
- Would customers immediately adopt a solution if it was provided it to them right now?

##### 3. What could this become? (Black Swan)

If this _did_ work, what could it become?

Airbnb started as [strangers sleeping on air beds in your livingroom](https://medium.com/@bchesky/7-rejections-7d894cbaa084). Uber started as towncars for the 1%.

As a fund, [the more experimental you are, the better the results](https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/1008039058113626112).

##### 4. Will this be one of the most important companies on the planet? (Mission & Vision)

Does this company have an important mission and vision?

##### 5. Why now and not before? (Timing, Secret)

What change or lack of change (like Drucker’s Seven Sources of Innovation) has created this opportunity?
- **An Unexpected Success or Failure**: Has something unexpected happened?
- **An Incongruity**: Is there a gap between the way things are and they way they should be?
	- Between the Reality of an Industry and Assumptions about it
	- Between Assumed and Actual Customer Values
- **A Process Need**: Are steps in a process missing, painful, or removable?
- **An Industry or Market Change**: Are regulations, technologies, or changing customer preferences disrupting an industry?
- **A Change in Demographics**: Are changes in populations, income, education, or age creating an opportunity?
- **A Change in Perception, Meaning, or Mood**: Has a widely held view of life changed? (ie: fat being bad vs good)
- **New Knowledge**: Will a new technology make something possible, easier, cheaper, or more powerful?

##### 6. Is this a world-class team? (Great Team)
Is there evidence of the founders:
- Executing successfully against the opportunity?
- Experimenting and learning rapidly?
- Attracting world-class people?

##### 7. Is this the right team? (Founder/Market Fit)

_<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank">22% of startups die because it’s the wrong team for the problem.</a>_
- Are the founders irrationally passionate about this problem?
- Do they understand the history of the market they’re entering?

##### 8. What is anomalous?

Is something (traction, team) exceptional?

##### 9. Do early users love it? (Product/Market Fit)

Have they found a [Value Hypothesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Psagej75WSLUNrTHq9zJ9ThDY_aKGvjD) that’s creating market pull?
- 5-7% week over week growth, mostly from word-of-mouth
- High engagement on the core function
- 40% of users being “very disappointed” if the product went away
- Retention cohorts that flatten

##### 10. Can they create an unfair advantage? (Unfair Advantage)

Will they be able to build one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisstoneman/notes-on-7-powers-foundations-of-business-by-hamilton-helmer-5d20cfecc753" target="_blank">7 Powers</a>?
- **Scale Economies**: A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.
- **Network Economies**: The value of a service to each user increases as new users join the network.
- **Counter Positioning**: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent can’t copy because it would damage their existing business.
- **Switching Costs**: The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternative supplier for additional purchases.
- **Branding**: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historic info about the seller.
- **Cornered Resource**: Preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.
- **Process Power**: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product.

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, start [Due Diligence](#due-diligence).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.

### Step 4: Due Diligence
Our investment due diligence is designed to be light weight but rigorous enough to uncover any red flags.

#### Our Goal

To decide whether or not to invest.

#### Our Questions
1. What do references say about the founders?
2. What do customers say about the company?
3. Is the cap table clean?
4. Are they raising enough to reach a logical next milestone?
5. Do we have pro-rata rights? 
6. Do we have information rights?
7. Do the founders agree to monthly updates?
8. Are we suffering from any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_cognitive\_biases" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>?

#### Requirements
1. Cap table
2. Company formation documents (Shareholder’s Agreement, Founder Vesting Agreements, etc)
3. Financing documents.
4. Contact information for a few reference customers.

#### Next Steps
**If yes**, we [start helping](#how-we-help).

**If no**, we share our analysis and feedback.
