### How You Can Help

1. Our new dashboard is not resonating with our users. *Can you help us identify where it's failing them?*
2. We're looking for someone to oversee a launch in Alberta. *Does anyone know a good potential city manager?*
3. We're spending a lot on customers. We're trying to identify if it is a product problem, or a marketing problem. *We'd like some guidance here.*
4. We've identified some challenging technical problems and we need to find someone with expertise in scaling our infrastructure. *Do you know any potential candidates?*

### Other Notes

1. We're expecting next month to be a little quiet as the school year has come to a close. We're looking at interesting ways to keep students and teachers engaged over the break.
2. We're planning a 6-month anniversary celebration, expect pictures to come!
